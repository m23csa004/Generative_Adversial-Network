The objective of this assignment was to generate realistic images from
paired/unpaired sketches using Conditional Generative Adversarial
Networks(cGANs). The Generator of the cGAN should be able to provide images
based on the sketch and label provided. For our assignment we used the paired
sketches to train the network and generate outputs.
The dataset provided in this case was the ISIC skin cancer dataset which contains
9016 images in the training set along with the same number of paired sketches.
The sketches were mainly the outline of the segmentation mask of the cancerous
part.
Similarly the test set contains 1000 pairs of images and their corresponding masks.
Generator and discriminator for CGAN was created.
Results were shown and accuracy were calculated.
